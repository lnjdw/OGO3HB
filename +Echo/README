                 Lafayette de Windt <l.n.j.d.windt@student.tue.nl>
Requires:        MathWorks Matlab
Tested on:       MathWorks Matlab R2012a (7.14.0.739)

-------------------------------------- Usage ----------------------------------------
Make sure the required software is installed before executing the steps below.

1. Open Matlab and add the root directory (the parent directory of the directory 
   containing this README file) to your path.
2. Look up the path to the video of the long axis cardiac echo, this can be a apical 
   four chamber view (AP4) or a left parasternal long axis view (PSL). Also look up
   the path of the video of the short axis cardiac echo, this should be a parasternal
   short axis view (PSD).
3. In the Command Window of Matlab, execute the function AnalyseEchos using the paths
   to the videos as arguments. So the commans should look like this:
   >> [volume error] = AnalyseEchos('/long/axis/view.avi', '/short/axis/view.avi');
4. A window appears displaying both videos (this may take some time, depending on the
   size of the videos). Use the left slider to go to the right frame in the left
   video. Then use the right slider to change the offset in time of the right
   video and make it display the desired frame of the right video. Once both videos
   are at the desired position in time it can be useful to remember the offset value
   for future use. When all is done press the continue button.
5. A new window appears displaying the long axis view. Drag the red line to the scale
   ruler and change its size to match a known real-life distance. Use the popup box
   at the bottom of the window to enter this real-life distance.
6. Now use the other popup box to choose the view corresponding to the current image.
   AP4 = apical four chamber view
   PSL = left parasternal long axis view
7. Press the button that says 'Draw Left Ventricle'. This activates a freehand
   drawing tool. Use this tool to draw the edges of the left ventricle. When not
   satisfied with the drawing, just press the button again and one can start over.
8. When the desired shape is drawn, double-click on the drawing. Now a new window
   appears that shows the other view. Use the green line in the first window to
   indicate the location at which the PSD echo is taken. Next, press the continue
   button.
9. A new window appears showing the short axis view. Drag the red line to the scale
   ruler and change its size to match a known real-life distance. Use the popup box
   at the bottom of the window to enter this real-life distance.
10.Now change the green ellipse to match the edges of the left ventricle and press
   the continue button.
11.A model of the left ventricle is now displayed. The text at the bottom gives the
   estimated volume of the ventricle (this also is the first output argument of the
   function). It also displays the difference (in cm) between the same distance in
   both images (the second output argument).
